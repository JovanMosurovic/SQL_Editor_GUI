# SQL Editor (with GUI)

This project encapsulates a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** based Database Management System (DBMS) developed in **C++** with a **JavaFX** front-end. It offers an interactive interface for users to manipulate databases, tables, and records. The system is designed to interpret and execute SQL-like commands, enabling a comprehensive suite of operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.

The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment for interacting with the database, improving upon the original command-line interface. Users can now execute SQL queries directly within the JavaFX application, visualize table structures, and receive real-time feedback on their queries.

Additionally, the system now supports a wider range of SQL queries, enhancing its versatility for database management tasks.\
The **C++ native code** from the original [SQL Editor project](https://github.com/JovanMosurovic/SQL_Editor) has been integrated into JavaFX, offering performance and functionality improvements. The C++ code has been adapted from that project to fit the native format required by this JavaFX application, and the modified version (with minor changes) can be found in the [`cpp`](https://github.com/JovanMosurovic/SQL_Editor_with_GUI/tree/master/src/cpp) folder (`/src/cpp`).

> The primary motivation behind this project was to master **JavaFX** and various data structures in the Java programming language, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of integrating **native C++** with Java. 
>
> This project was developed as the [second university assignment](instructions.pdf) for "Practicum of Object-Oriented Programming" at the University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering majoring in Software Engineering. Please refer to the file for detailed assignment instructions.

## Running the Project

This guide assumes that Java and JavaFX are already installed and properly configured on your system.<br /> 
The instructions below do not cover the installation of these prerequisites.

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the C++ native environment**  
   Before launching the application, execute the appropriate script based on your operating system:  
   - [**Windows:**](#running-on-windows) `scriptWindows.bat`  
   - [**Linux:**](#running-on-linux) `scriptLinux.sh`
   - [**macOS:**](#running-on-macos) `scriptMacOS.sh`

   ðŸš¨ **Important:** Ensure that the script is correctly configured by specifying the **path** to the C++ native code directory within the project. 

2. **Verify JavaFX and Java installation**  
   Confirm that your development environment supports **JavaFX** and that **Java** is properly installed, as the application relies on JavaFX for the GUI.

3. **Run the application**  
   After all of the previous steps have been completed successfully, runÂ theÂ project.

  ## Running on Linux  

  To properly set up and run the application on Linux, follow these steps:  

  ### 1. Set the `JAVA_HOME` Environment Variable  
  Define the `JAVA_HOME` variable to point to your JDK installation:  
  ```bash
  JAVA_HOME=/home/hp/.jdks/corretto-1.8.0_412
  ```  

  ### 2. Verify the Presence of JNI Headers  
  Ensure that the required JNI headers are available in the expected directories:  
  ```bash
  ls $JAVA_HOME/include
  ls $JAVA_HOME/include/linux
  ```  
  Expected output:  
  - The `jni.h` file should be present in the `include` directory.  
  - The `jni_md.h` file should be present in the `include/linux` subdirectory.  

  ### 3. Export the `JAVA_HOME` Variable  
  To make the `JAVA_HOME` variable available to subprocesses, export it:  
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME
  ```  
  **Note:** Do not use `=` when exporting, as it would reset the variable.  

  ### 4. Add the Java `bin` Directory to `PATH`  
  To ensure that Java binaries can be accessed globally, add the `bin` directory to your `PATH`:  
  ```bash
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```  

  ### 5. Grant Execution Permission to the Script  
  If running a shell script, ensure it has execution permissions:  
  ```bash
  chmod +x scriptLinux.sh
  ```  
  Then, execute the script:  
  ```bash
  ./scriptLinux.sh
  ```  
  **Note**: All environment variable exports are session-specific. For permanent configuration, add to `~/.bashrc` or equivalent shell profile.

  ### 6. Wait for Script Completion  
  The script will execute multiple commands required for the native environment. **Wait until all commands complete and the counter reaches 0** before proceeding.  

  Once the script has finished, you can run the program in your development environment.  

  ðŸ’¡ **Suggestion:** *You can use any IDE of your choice, but [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is recommended since the project and all tests were developed and tested in it.*  

  ### 7. Add Configuration for Native Files
To configure the application to support the native files, follow these steps:

- Open the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog by selecting your current file in the IDE.
- Choose **Edit Configurations** from the menu.
- Click the `+` button and select **Application**.
- In the **Main class** field, enter `app.Main` or search for it by clicking the **Browse** icon or using the shortcut `Shift + Enter` (`app -> Main`).
- Click on **Modify options**, then check **Add VM options**.
- In the **VM options** field, add the following line:
  ```bash
  -Djava.library.path=native
  ```
**Note:** This step is specifically for IntelliJ IDEA. If you're using a different IDE, the process for configuring the application might differ. Generally, look for a way to add VM options or set environment variables in the configuration settings for your specific IDE.

  ## Running on macOS  

   ### Installing Homebrew

   I recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing dependencies, as it was the easiest method I used, and it has proven to be the most straightforward.

   To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
   After installation, ensure Homebrew is working by running:
```bash
brew --version
```
   This should return the installed Homebrew version.
   
   ### Compiler Setup 
   
   ðŸš¨ By default, macOS uses **Clang** as the compiler. However, **Clang** does not compile C++ native code correctly, so it is necessary to use a different compiler.
   **GCC** is used in the instructions because the project has been tested and works correctly with it. Other compilers can be used, but using a different compiler might lead to 
   errors.

   ### 1. Install GCC via Homebrew
   If you haven't installed GCC, you can install it by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install gcc
   ```

   ### 2. Verify GCC Installation
   Once GCC is installed, verify the installation by checking the version of the Homebrew-installed GCC. The command will differ based on your system architecture:

For **Apple Silicon (M1/M2)**:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/g++-14 --version
```

For **Intel Mac**:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/g++-14 --version
```

The expected output should resemble the following:

```plaintext
g++-14 (Homebrew GCC 14.1.0) 14.1.0
```

**Note:**  
If the version returned is different from `14` (e.g., `g++-12`, `g++-13`), you will need to update the script by replacing all occurrences of `/opt/homebrew/bin/g++-14` with the version number shown in your output (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/g++-12`).
  
   ### Running the project
   To set up and run the project on macOS, follow these steps:

### 1. Grant Execution Permission to the Script
For running a shell script, ensure it has execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x scriptMacOS.sh
```

### 2. Run the Script
After the script has execution permissions, run it:
```bash
./scriptMacOS.sh
```
**Note**: All environment variable exports are session-specific. For permanent configuration, add to `~/.zshrc` (for zsh) or `~/.bash_profile` (for bash).

### 3. Wait for Script Completion  
  The script will execute multiple commands required for the native environment. **Wait until all commands complete and the counter reaches 0** before proceeding.  

  Once the script has finished, you can run the program in your development environment.  

  ðŸ’¡ **Suggestion:** *You can use any IDE of your choice, but [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is recommended since the project and all tests were developed and tested in it.*  

### 4. Add Configuration for Native Files
To configure the application to support the native files, follow these steps:

- Open the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog by selecting your current file in the IDE.
- Choose **Edit Configurations** from the menu.
- Click the `+` button and select **Application**.
- In the **Main class** field, enter `app.Main` or search for it by clicking the **Browse** icon or using the shortcut `Shift + Enter` (`app -> Main`).
- Click on **Modify options**, then check **Add VM options**.
- In the **VM options** field, add the following line:
  ```bash
  -Djava.library.path=native
  ```
**Note:** This step is specifically for IntelliJ IDEA. If you're using a different IDE, the process for configuring the application might differ. Generally, look for a way to add VM options or set environment variables in the configuration settings for your specific IDE.
